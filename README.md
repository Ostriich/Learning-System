# Learning-System
Interactive computer system that teaches the development of algorithms.
The system is the result of a final qualifying work.
It is intended for self-study of the theory of algorithms and obtaining skills in algorithm development.
The Unity platform was used as the development environment.
The system contains theoretical, test and interactive parts.
The interactivity of the program lies in the possibility provided to the user of compiling an algorithm from semantic blocks.
